# 1. Introduction
    Betterduke is a desktop application for NUS students with poor time management. 
    Students, more often than not, are on their laptops, hence Betterduke
    will provide a convenient platform for students to toggle between checking their timetables
    and scheduling their tasks. More importantly, Betterduke is optimized for those who
    prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
    of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Betterduke can
    schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.  Enjoy!

# 2. QuickStart
Ensure you have Java ​ 11 ​or above installed in your Computer.
Installation guide:
1. Download the latest jar file here

2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your BetterDuke.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.  
3.1. Open Terminal  
3.2. Change the path to the directory the file is located. By using the command ‘cd’. E.g. Type ‘cd Desktop/’ this changes the path to Desktop if the folder exist.  
3.3. Next, type the command shown, ‘java -jar v1.4.jar‘. This will startup the application.  
3.4. Initially, the week view timetable for event is not populated, upon entering a command, the timetable will display the week based on the week label shown in the GUI.   
3.5 If you wish to navigate to other week please enter the command: show/week <x> where <x> is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive, or ‘recess’, ‘reading’ or ‘exam’.
